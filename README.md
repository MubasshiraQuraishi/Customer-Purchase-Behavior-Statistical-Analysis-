Using statistical analysis (Chi-Square, T-Test, Z-Test, Z-Test for Proportion, ANOVA), I explored patterns in customer purchases across **age, gender, seasons, subscription status, Category, Location, Color and promo code usage** â€” without using machine learning. Just pure analysis and business logic!

ðŸ“Œ **Key insights:**
- Customers aged **41â€“50** are the most engaged buyers â€” a strong focus group for future campaigns.
- **Clothing and Accessories** lead across **all seasons** â€” clear winners for inventory and marketing.
- **Gender doesnâ€™t influence how frequently people shop**, so keep campaigns **gender-neutral**.
- Surprisingly, **subscription users purchase less** than non-subscribers â€” loyalty programs need a rethink.
- And my favorite takeaway:  
  **Male customers use promo codes more effectively** than females â€” a smart lesson in purchasing power!

ðŸ“Š No fancy ML â€” just good old statistics + Python + business thinking.
